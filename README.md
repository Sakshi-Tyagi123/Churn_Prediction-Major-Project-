# Churn Prediction

## Overview
Churn Prediction is a machine learning-based approach to identify customers who are likely to leave a service, helping businesses take proactive measures to retain them.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning model training (Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and selection based on performance metrics
- Web application integration for user-friendly predictions using FastAPI

## Dataset
The project utilizes telecom customer data to analyze customer behavior and predict churn. The dataset includes various features like customer tenure, contract type, payment method, and service usage.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React (for web integration)
- **Database**: .csv files
